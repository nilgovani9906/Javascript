<!-- **Question:**
Imagine you are building a drawing application. You have a `Shape` class with a method `draw()` that prints "Drawing a shape" to the console. Create two subclasses, `Circle` and `Square`, both inheriting from the `Shape` class. Override the `draw()` method in both subclasses so that `Circle` prints "Drawing a circle" and `Square` prints "Drawing a square". Create instances of both `Circle` and `Square` classes and call the `draw()` method on each instance.  -->
